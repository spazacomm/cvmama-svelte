By using this website and our services, you represent, acknowledge, and agree that you are at least 18 years of age and have the right, authority, and capacity to agree to and abide by these Terms. You also represent that you will use the website and our services in a manner consistent with any and all applicable laws and regulations. By engaging the services of Find My Profession, you hereby authorize Find My Profession to act on your behalf in the completion and submission of job applications. This includes the authority to fill out application forms and to digitally sign any necessary documents related to your job applications. In order to use any of the services offered by FMP, including but not limited to, resume review, career counseling, interview coaching, social media review, and job application assistance, you will have to create a Client Account on the website. To do this, you must register on the site by choosing a Username and Password. You agree not to use any other person’s client account. You also agree to not let anyone else use your client account. When creating your account on the website, you represent that all information given is accurate and complete. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must notify Find My Profession immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Find My Profession will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account. FMP may terminate this Agreement and your use of this website and our services at any time without notice if we believe that you are less than 18 years old or if you have violated this Agreement in any other way.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Payment And Fees</h2>
<p dir="ltr">If you purchase any of our career services, FMP will collect the total price of the package in accordance with the pricing terms on the website. Payment for FMP services is due upfront and collected before our work begins. FMP is not responsible for any fees charged to you by your bank in relation to our collection of payment. As part of any purchase made through the website, you will be asked to provide your name, email, phone number, billing address, and credit or debit card information to either FMP or a third-party payment processor. You agree to pay FMP for any services purchased by one of the methods described on the website. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the service either directly by FMP or indirectly via a third-party payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the website. If you are directed to FMP’s third-party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing the use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services.</p>
<p>Refunds, if any, are at the sole and absolute discretion of FMP and will be in the form of either a credit for FMP services or a money-back refund. FMP reserves the right to determine in what form the refund will be given. If an individual requests a refund for a bundled package or multi-month service package, and they have already completed part of the service, they will receive a refund for the unused portion of the package. However, the portion of the package already used will be charged at its full, non-discounted price, and the refund amount will reflect the remaining balance after this adjustment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the event that FMP terminates your account or this Agreement for your breach of this Agreement, you understand and agree that you shall receive no refund or exchange for any unused time on any package or fees for any portion of our services, any content or data associated with your account, or for anything else. All purchases are non-transferable and may not be transferred to another individual or entity.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Service Expiration</h2>
<p dir="ltr">All resume services purchased must be redeemed within 90 days of purchasing the service. For all resume services, if the client does not contact their resume writer within 90 days to begin work on the resume or any other documents, their purchased services will be considered void with no refunds given. Should the client fail to contact their resume writer or a Find My Profession representative within 90 days of ordering the service, their order will be marked as “completed,” and no refund will be given.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All reverse recruiting services purchased must be redeemed within 6 months of purchasing the service. For all reverse recruiting services, if the client does not begin services within 6 months of purchasing the initial service period or request a refund for unused services, their order will be marked as “completed” and no refund will be given.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Reverse Recruiting Service Guidelines</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Our Reverse Recruiting Service is designed to provide dedicated support over a 30-calendar-day service period, operating Monday through Friday. Clients can expect approximately 20 days of service per 30-day service period; however, please note that holidays may affect the total days of service received during each service period. Please be aware that the Reverse Recruiting Unlimited service will be discontinued after 12 months of engagement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Each client will be assigned a dedicated Reverse Recruiting and Career Coach, provided that the Career Coaching service has been purchased. While we strive to maintain continuity with your assigned Reverse Recruiter and Career Coach, we reserve the right to change these individuals at any time without reason or cause. Additionally, we reserve the right to discontinue service if a client is not actively engaged in the service or fails to complete tasks as requested.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once you have confirmed your launch date for your prepaid Reverse Recruiting service period with your Client Onboarding Specialist, there will be no refunds, launch date changes, or pauses to the service during the initial service period.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Reverse Recruiting 6-Month Job Offer Guarantee</h2>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">We are pleased to offer a job offer guarantee with our Premier and Elite Reverse Recruiting packages. If you do not receive a job offer or at least 5 interviews after using our services for 6 consecutive months, we will extend your services at no cost until you do receive a job offer or a total of 5 interviews, for up to another 6 months.</p>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">A job offer is defined as an offer of employment from an employer to you, regardless of whether you accept it. An interview refers to a formal meeting with any individual involved in the hiring decision for a position or target company that you have approved, including but not limited to recruiters and hiring managers. Each interview counts towards the guarantee, irrespective of your attendance. Find My Profession maintains discretion regarding whether an interview qualifies for the guarantee.</p>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">To maintain eligibility for the job offer guarantee, you must:</p>
<ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet p-rich_text_list--nested" data-stringify-type="unordered-list" data-list-tree="true" data-indent="0" data-border="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Use our Premier or Elite Reverse Recruiting services (including our resume writing services) for a total of 6 consecutive service months without any gaps.</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Maintain the same job target goals and utilize the same Find My Profession resume throughout your service.</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Respond to messages from your Reverse Recruiter (RR) within 48 hours.</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Attend all scheduled interviews and networking calls.</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Approve or reject job opportunities presented by the RR within 48 hours.</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Participate in at least two weekly Zoom meetings per month with your RR.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">Delays in these commitments or lack of client engagement that impact the job search process will void the guarantee. Find My Profession reserves the right to deem a client ineligible for this guarantee if the client’s actions or decisions prevent us from fulfilling the service requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, rejecting job opportunities that align with the client’s established search criteria and expectations. Find My Profession has sole discretion in determining whether a client meets the eligibility requirements for this guarantee, based on their search criteria, engagement level, and overall expectations.</p>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">The job offer guarantee activates after 6 service months. If a job offer or the expected number of interviews is not secured during this period, you may qualify for an additional 6 months of free support, provided that all conditions are met. For example, if you receive one qualified interview during the initial 6 months, services will continue at no cost until a job offer or the remaining four required interviews are secured, for up to an additional 6 months. Once the guarantee conditions are fulfilled or a job offer is received, services will conclude without additional fees. Eligibility is formally reviewed by leadership only after six consecutive months of service, once all criteria have been verified.</p>
<h2>Resume Writing 60-Day Interview Guarantee</h2>
<p>We offer a straightforward 60-day interview guarantee. If you do not receive noticeably more interviews after 60 days of using the resume we created for you, while applying for jobs that match your resume’s job target, we will rewrite your resume one time at no additional charge.</p>
<p>To qualify for this guarantee, we recommend applying to at least&nbsp;5 jobs per week, totaling approximately&nbsp;40 jobs over the 60-day period. This level of engagement helps ensure that you are actively utilizing your resume in the job market.</p>
<p>If you meet these application guidelines and still do not see a significant increase in interview opportunities, please contact us at&nbsp;<a class="c-link" href="mailto:help@findmyprofession.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="mailto:help@findmyprofession.com" data-sk="tooltip_parent">help@findmyprofession.com</a>&nbsp;to initiate the revision process.</p>
